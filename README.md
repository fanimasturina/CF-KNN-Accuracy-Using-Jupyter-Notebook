# CF-KNN-Accuracy-Using-Jupyter-Notebook
On my thesis project, i created an expert system that calculates the result of dental diagnoses using Certainty Factor and K Nearest Neighbor (the application and data sources still on hold because i havent done the thesis defense yet). This is the calculation of accuracy of the methods, i'm using python 3 (ipykernel) and Jupyter Notebook as a framework to calculate the accuracy.
